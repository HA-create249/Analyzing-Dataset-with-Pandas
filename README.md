# Analyzing Dataset with Pandas

This project represents my initial exploration into data analysis using the Pandas library within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The dataset analyzed pertains to the team of the YMH Global initiative, providing a practical context for applying data manipulation and analysis techniques.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about the team members of the YMH Global initiative. While specific details of the dataset are not provided, typical analyses may include:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Statistical summaries
* Data visualization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook([GitHub][1])

## 📈 Project Structure

* `pandas_project_1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis of the YMH Global team dataset.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required Python libraries (listed above)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
